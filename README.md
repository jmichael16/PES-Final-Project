### Brief ###
This repository contains code for my Final Project for ECEN 5813 (Principles of Embedded Software) at CU, Boulder for Fall 2020. The ultimate goal for the project was to use several of the topics discussed throughout the course to create something interesting for the FRDM-KL25Z development platform.  My idea for the project was to do music visualization using a microphone, the ADC and some LEDs. Refer to the [documentation](documentation) for further details about the hardware and software development process as well as some test results.
